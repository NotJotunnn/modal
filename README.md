# Modal!
This is another project that is part from freecodecamp's yt channel! link: https://youtu.be/3PHXvlpOkf4

This project I've decided to take beyond my usual challenges, adding on top of making a working modal, making it both beautiful and flexible (so that no matter the resolution of the device, there would always be a nice picture in the background!).

At last, these challenges are in fact, made by myself, I really only take the base model from the original source referenced bellow!

## Reference:
https://vanilla-js-basic-project-6-modal.netlify.app/

## Practiced:

    1. Using scripted fonts from fontawesome
    2. Window event based (to create dynamic images)
    3. Picsum API
    4. Transitions
